Finite Element Analysis of a 1D Rod

Overview

This project implements a Finite Element Method (FEM) solution for a 1D rod under a uniform distributed load. The program assembles the global stiffness matrix and load vector, applies boundary conditions, and solves for nodal displacements using the Thomas algorithm for tridiagonal systems.


Features

Uses the Thomas algorithm to efficiently solve the tridiagonal system.

Assembles global stiffness and load matrices for a 1D rod.

Computes nodal displacements, strains, and stresses.

Visualizes results using Matplotlib.


Dependencies

This script requires the following Python libraries:

numpy

matplotlib

You can install the required dependencies using:

pip install numpy matplotlib


The script will output the nodal displacements and plot:

Displacement vs. x

Strain vs. x

Stress vs. x


Input Parameters

N: Number of nodes (default: 100)

E: Young's modulus (default: 200 GPa)

A: Cross-sectional area (default: 0.01 mÂ²)

L: Length of the rod (default: 1.0 m)

f: Uniform distributed load (default: 1000 N/m)


Output

The script prints nodal displacements.

Plots of displacement, strain, and stress distributions along the rod.

Boundary Conditions

The rod is fixed at x = 0 (zero displacement at the first node).

A uniform load is applied across the rod.
